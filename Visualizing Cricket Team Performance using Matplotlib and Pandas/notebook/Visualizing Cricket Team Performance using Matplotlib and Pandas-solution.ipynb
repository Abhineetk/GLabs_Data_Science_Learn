    "# IPL Dataset Analysis\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "We want to know as to what happens during an IPL match which raises several questions in our mind with our limited knowledge about the game called cricket on which it is based. This analysis is done to know as which factors led one of the team to win and how does it matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the Dataset :\n",
    "The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional T20 cricket league in India contested during April-May of every year by teams representing Indian cities. It is the most-attended cricket league in the world and ranks sixth among all the sports leagues. It has teams with players from around the world and is very competitive and entertaining with a lot of close matches between teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPL and other cricket related datasets are available at [cricsheet.org](https://cricsheet.org). Feel free to visit the website and explore the data by yourself as exploring new sources of data is one of the interesting activities a data scientist gets to do.\n",
